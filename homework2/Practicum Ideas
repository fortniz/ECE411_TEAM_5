Practicum Idea 

1.) Draw Pad -
The draw pad will use sensors (touch sensors?) that captures some form of contact and will record 
the contact movements and will either display them on a screen or a panel of LEDs will show the display. 
Using a microcontroller to output the movements to an LED display.
